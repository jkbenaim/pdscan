NAME
       pdscan - describe IRIX software products

SYNOPSIS
       pdscan -f pdfile

DESCRIPTION
       pdscan will describe an IRIX software package, given its product
       description file.

       Software packages for the IRIX operating system are typically
       prodived as a set ("distribution") of files. This is in contrast to
       other operating systems, where a package might be contained in a
       single file, such as a .deb, .rpm, or .msi file.

       An IRIX package consists of three or more files:

	      product
		     The product description file. This is the file which
		     pdscan should be pointed at. This is a small file
		     containing the name and version of the package, along
		     with various directives.

	      product.idb
		     The file database. This is an ASCII file listing all
		     files contained in the package.

	      product.man, product.data, etc.
		     These are containers for the actual data of the
		     package. The package may contain multiple "images",
		     such as "man" or "data", which are in separate
		     containers and may be installed separately.

BUGS
       pdscan understands product description versions 5 through 9. Other
       versions might exist, but they have not been observed by the author.
